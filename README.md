All files denoted with "Whats the Plane" in the file name include a crystal plane example for the students to analyze and solve for the miller indices. 

All files denoted with the respective Unit Cell structure in the file name are templates with axes to help students plot planes, which is left to the discretion of the person running the activity. 

An example of the activity is provided under the Gravity Sketch folder (To be added). 

A tutorial video is linked to show students how Gravity Sketch can be used to visualize and draw these crystal planes (To be added). Please note that this brief video is not meant to overwhelm the students with the possibilities of using Gravity Sketch, but it is to be shown to students for this specific activity. The video serves as a guide on how to use Gravity Sketch to supplement the students understanding of crystal structures. The video is not a comprehensive tutorial on how to use Gravity Sketch or a guide to set up the activity for the students. Additional research may be necessary to complete this activity, which could include how to load an obj file into Gravity Sketch, change the color of certain objects, etc.
